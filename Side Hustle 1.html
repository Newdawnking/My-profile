            Born on 25 June 1980, Apostle Joshua Selman is a man who has dedicated much of his entire life in service to God, raising and nurturing many in the ministry of Jesus. He is the founder of Eternity Network International, a ministry that transforms lives through God’s word. When the Apostle speaks, you’ve just got to listen and none can leave the atmosphere of his ministration without a life-changing experience.
            In honor to the Man of God who celebrates his birthday today, here’s what some people have to say about the impact of his ministry in their lives

                Apostle Joshua Selman’s message “Above the storm” made me come to the understanding that a man can live above the storms of life if he has truly come to terms with kingdom principles of Joy, Prayer and Prophecy. He is an Apostle, seasoned and practical teacher of the word who also functions in a plethora of spiritual graces. Happy Birthday to God’s General

                The greatest service a man can render is one to God and one to God is the service to lives. To see people set free by knowledge and set loose from the shackles of deceit from the enemy. You have done this sir. I pray that you are preserved much more in the ministry of Jesus. Happy Birthday Apostle.

            My first encounter with you at the University of Ibadan was unforgettable. Your ministration and your impartations that night will form some life-changing experiences that ever crossed my path. Happy birthday man of God.

                Words will fail to describe Apostle Joshua Selman completely, the lives he has blessed, transformed through his spirit-engaging messages, or his selfless personality, or the doggedness he exhibits in keeping to his vision. A true model for the young minister you are sir.
            
            
                And here at nkechieluwa’s blog, we want to say a very happy birthday to you and that WE LOVE YOU SIR.
